# Hardware Porting Notes

reFrame is intentionally small and mostly contained in `reframe.py`. If you want to use a different camera, display, or button, you can keep the same high-level logic and swap the hardware-specific adapter code.

## Display

The default display adapter is `EInkDisplay` in `reframe.py`, using the bundled Waveshare `epd4in0e` driver.

To port another e-ink display:

- Update `DISPLAY_IMAGE_WIDTH`, `DISPLAY_IMAGE_HEIGHT`, `DISPLAY_PANEL_WIDTH`, and `DISPLAY_PANEL_HEIGHT`.
- Update the palettes and hardware color mapping in `ImageProcessor`.
- Keep `EInkDisplay`'s public methods compatible: `prepare_async`, `is_busy`, `display_image`, `display_buffer`, `display_buffer_async`, `display_photo_by_id`, `clear_display`, `display_dashboard_qr`, and `sleep`.

You can find similar E Ink Spectra 6 displays from other brands like Pimoroni, GooDisplay, etc.

## Camera

The default camera adapter is `CameraManager`, backed by Picamera2 and Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3.

To port another camera:

- Keep `capture_image_with_metadata()` returning `(result_dict, PIL_image)`.
- Make `capture_image()` return a PIL `RGB` image.
- Keep `configure_camera()`, `reload_settings()`, and `apply_camera_settings()` present, even if some settings become no-ops.
- Update or remove `scripts/enable_hdr.sh` and the `_enable_camera_hdr()` startup call in `reframe.py` if your camera does not use Camera Module 3 HDR.
- Update `settings.example.json` camera defaults for the resolution and controls your camera supports.

## Button And Power

The default button path reads PiSugar 3 over I2C in `main()`. To port another trigger:

- Replace `is_power_button_pressed()` in `main()`.
- Keep the short-press behavior calling `camera_system.capture_photo_api()`.
- Keep long-press shutdown behavior in the power manager if your hardware has one; otherwise implement it explicitly.

## Dashboard

The dashboard talks to the hardware service through the API routes in `reframe.py`. If the adapter methods above remain compatible, the dashboard should not need display- or camera-specific changes.
